Real data, only hard evidence, 10000 samples

Real data, only hard evidence, 50000 samples
3.csv
Real data, includes soft evidence, 5000 samples
Study cge00020 (should have turned on due to C05381) soft evidence
C05381 metfrag score 0.75
This is likely due the way hard evidence comes into play. We currently set any
hard evidence as g_f = 1, however in reality it should be g_f >= 1
Next we will try including this information via virtual nodes
4.csv
Real data, includes soft evidence, 5000 samples
Used a virtual node node conditioned on g_f != 0. 
Drove all pathway probabilities to 0.5, used 0.999 as "hard evidence", trying 0.99. Perhaps more samples???
5.csv
Real data, includes soft evidence, 100000 samples
Same parameters as 3
This suggests that more sampling is needed, as cge00020 activated to 0.5
