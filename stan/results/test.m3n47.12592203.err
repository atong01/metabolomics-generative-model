Warning (non-fatal): assignment operator <- deprecated in the Stan language; use = instead.

INFO:pystan:COMPILING THE C++ CODE FOR MODEL anon_model_09a86879dd91346335f8a225b05da989 NOW.
Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception thrown at line 28: gamma_log: Shape parameter[2] is 0, but must be > 0!
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
