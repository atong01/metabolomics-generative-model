modelB-NB

modelB of naive bayes type.

this model consists of 4 levels as below

p_1 p_2 p_3 ... p_n
 \/
m_1 m_2 m_3 ... m_m
 ^
v_1 v_2 v_3 ... v_k
 ^
x_1 ... x_n

Evidence nodes are unconfirmed X nodes with size = m, the number of metabolites. Soft evidence is provided and m_1 ... m_m are calculated based on this evidence and prior distributions on p_1 ... p_n

Once we calculate marginal distributions for each metabolite, we use these as a prior for the next time step where we calculate a new distribution on each pathway.

Each modelA-NB is used as a time step until convergence of the model.

This is essentially an unfolding into a HMM of time steps, however it is slightly odd that our model always observes the same data. 


INITIAL FINDINGS
----------------
After running with test1, 1 metabolite, I found that it the smoother engine cannot run with soft evidence. It seems to work well enough with hard evidence.
