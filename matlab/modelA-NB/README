modelA-NB

modelA of naive bayes type.

this model consists of 4 levels as below

p_1 p_2 p_3 ... p_n
 \/
m_1 m_2 m_3 ... m_m
 ^
v_1 v_2 v_3 ... v_k
 ^
x_1 ... x_n

Evidence nodes are unconfirmed X nodes with size = m, the number of metabolites. Soft evidence is provided and m_1 ... m_m are calculated based on this evidence and prior distributions on p_1 ... p_n


v_i is true iff any parent node (only unconfirmed) evaluates to i

m_i is true iff any parent is true

p_i starts with an initial .5 .5 distribution.
